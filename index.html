                    <h2 class="section-header" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Going Home Club -  A club for people that have no intention 
                        of joining a club.<br> 

                            There’s no way such a club actually exists, right?<br><br>
                            
                            It does exist!?<br><br>
                            
                            You would be forgiven if you took a quick 
                            glance at the title, poster, and synopsis and thought 
                            that this was just another school centered show 
                            featuring girls doing ordinary things. It does mostly take place in a school, 
                            however, the things that the girls of the Going Home Club do are not what you 
                            would normally see in the normal school comedy show. 
                            In fact, the show very well could be considered quite different 
                            from the usual school comedy show with the complete disregard for the 4th wall 
                            with plenty of meta references that viewers with knowledge of the 
                            current topic can nod and say, 
                            “hey, I know what they’re talking about!”

                        “Let me introduce the crazy members of the Going Home Club!” - Sakura Doumyouji, Club President<br><br>

                        Club Members - asterisk represents a new member that joined in ep. 1 <br>
                        Sakura Doumyouji - Class 2-1, Club President <br>
                        Botan Oohagi - Class 2-1, Martial arts specialist <br>
                        Claire Kokonoe - Class 2-5, Ojou-sama <br>
                        Natsuki Andou* - “Straight Man” <br>
                        Karin Touno* - “moe” character <br>
                        Interestingly enough, Sakura is the most “normal” 
                        character of the three that were in the club before                             
                        Natsuki and Karin joined. The other two with her? 
                        Not so much. Botan, the 16th heir to the Hagizuki-ryuu 
                        martial arts style and Claire, the daughter of the head 
                        of the Kokonoe Corporation (super wealthy/well known). 
                        Lastly you have Sakura, blood type A and born under 
                        the sign of Taurus. A totally ordinary girl when compared 
                        to the other two. Then we look at the two new members, 
                        Natsuki and Karin. Natsuki (or Nacchan as Karin calls her),                             
                        is easily distinguished from the rest of the club members 
                        by her ahoge (hair antenna). Interestingly enough, she 
                        defies the typical “dumb character with dumb hair” 
                        trope and is often (more like 97%) of the time the most 
                        “normal” character in the club. She typically will retort 
                        to comments made by members of the club when there is either
                        a flaw in the comment or it straight up doesn’t make sense. 
                        Lastly, we have Karin. The “moe” character. The cute 
                        character of the club. She fits in to the tropes side 
                        of the club next to Claire who interestingly really wants 
                        Karin as her younger sister. We see this throughout the show 
                        and she takes it as far as calling a sniper in case the club 
                        lost a soccer match where Karin was the sacrifice.

                    <h2 id="activities">But what does the "Going Home Club do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <br><span class="fun">“We have fun!”</span> <br><br>
                        What is this “fun” that you speak of? It consists of anything. 
                        From communicating baseball strategies via telepathy or 
                        talking about your experience fighting bears around the world, 
                        nothing is safe from the Going Home Club! This is where the 
                        show starts to differentiate itself from the typical school 
                        comedy show. As mentioned before, Natsuki, the “straight man” 
                        of the show, will almost always be seen interjecting jokes that 
                        members of the club makes. This can be a huge turn-off for some, 
                        as they may not like the joke being explained every time or someone
                        screaming what is wrong with the joke. But I enjoyed it. 
                        Although I think some portions are more directed towards 
                        the general Japanese audience (it’s an anime, I know.) 
                        so you won’t enjoy those certain parts unless you have 
                        some knowledge into Japanese literature. Similar to 
                        Tesagure! Bukatsu-mono, Kitakubu heavily references 
                        different stuff and it is fun to catch the stuff that 
                        is referenced. 
                        <br><br>
                        I never thought I would see Schubert in a slice of life anime. 
                            
                        One of the most important things in a school slice of life 
                        is to not bore the watcher and spice things up with interesting 
                        things. Kitakubu does this in an incredibly unique way not seen 
                        in many school-based slice-of-life shows with its quirky characters, 
                        fun and weird activities, and the primary goal of it all, 
                        going home above all! The characters are interesting in their own ways, 
                        and characters are another important driving point in slice-of-life shows. 
                        Overall, I think that Kitakubu is one of my favorite school shows that 
                        I have seen so far. And I watch quite a lot of slice-of-life shows that 
                        take place in schools. I have not touched the source manga, and due to the 
                        lack of an official/fan translation combined with not being able to find the 
                        original manga anywhere online for sale, 
                        I probably won’t ever be able to read the entirety of it.
