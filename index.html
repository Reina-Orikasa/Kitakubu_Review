                    <p>The Going Home Club -  A club for people that have no intention of joining a club. Hence the “going home” part.<br> 

                            There’s no way such a club actually exists, right?<br><br>
                            
                            It does exist!?<br><br>
                            
                            You would be forgiven if you took a quick 
                            glance at the title, poster, and synopsis and thought 
                            that this was just another school centered show 
                            featuring girls doing ordinary things. It does mostly take place in a school, 
                            however, the things that the girls of the Going Home Club do are not what you 
                            would normally see in the normal school comedy show. 
                            In fact, the show very well could be considered quite different 
                            from the usual school comedy show with the complete disregard for the 4th wall 
                            with plenty of meta references that viewers with knowledge of the 
                            current topic can nod and say, 
                            “hey, I know what they’re talking about!”
